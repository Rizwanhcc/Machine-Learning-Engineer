# Machine-Learning-Engineer
In this repository you can take a look at my portfolio projects build for Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree offered by Udacity.

### Machine Learning in Production
Learn how to deploy machine learning models to a production environment using Amazon SageMaker.

#### PROJECT- Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model
Build and deploy a deep learning model that predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review using Amazon SageMaker. In addition, create a simple web app that uses your deployed model and accepts user input.

### Machine Learning Case Studies
Apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world tasks; explore data and deploy both built-in and custom-made Amazon SageMaker models.

#### PROJECT- Plagiarism Detector
Use your advanced machine learning skills to define similarity metrics between two text documents and identify cases of plagiarism. You’ll perform feature engineering and train and deploy a custom, plagiarism-classification model using Amazon SageMaker.


### Machine Learning Capstone
In this capstone lesson, you’ll select a machine learning challenge and propose a possible solution.

#### PROJECT- Capstone Proposal and Project
Define a problem you want to solve. Then, explore the relevant data, perform feature extraction and modeling steps, and develop a set of final insights. You will present the analysis and your insights in a blog post and GitHub repository. This project will serve as a demonstration of end-to-end machine learning skills that will be an important piece of your job-ready portfolio.
